    "When I logged into this website for the first time, I didn't have a business or even a business.
    I went and started it small and now the whole of Nairobi knows me as the best Dog-Seller."

    "I started my tomato business with just ksh.3000. I went on to build a tomato empire. I went to Marikiti,
    bought one crate of tomatoes. Placed it on a wheelbarrow and from there the business boomed. This is all
    because of the business ideas and advices I got from this website. The website gives detailed explaination
    of starting any type of business. "
