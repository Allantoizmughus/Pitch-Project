      A DJ, or disc jockey, is a person who hosts recorded music for an audience. Simple!

But there are many different kinds of DJs, and many reasons for them to exist. Before we start your journey into DJing, let’s take a quick dive into what they actually do:

Club DJs
Every club has a different feel, reputation, and audience… which means they vary in what’s expected from their musical selection. Normally, the club DJ’s job is maintaining a moving dance floor. Club DJs may perform long blends (called transitions) between songs, or some other trickery to keep people’s feet moving.

When a DJ performs at a venue regularly or permanently, they’re called a resident DJ. They must know how to ramp the energy up and down, maintaining the balance between an active dance floor and a busy bar.

“Club DJs” who have built a following may also perform at bars, music venues, festivals, etc.

Mobile DJs
These DJs perform at your wedding, set the tone for your corporate event, or provide a memorable prom party.

Often the entrepreneurial type, mobile DJs have lots to keep track of. They may be solely responsible for the setup and teardown of equipment, planning the show, managing the crowd, and making any announcements.

This kind of DJ may need to be comfortable taking requests (and sometimes even entire playlists), speaking into a microphone, and investing in sound equipment.

Radio DJs
The entire concept of DJing owes it’s origins to radio.

The radio DJ’s job varies greatly, from the person who announces the weather between songs, to full-on music curation. While many corporate radio DJs have lost control over the music, the art lives on in podcast format.

Turntablists (and other “Performance” DJs)
People go to see this DJ because of their skill, reputation, and what they can do behind the decks. Their mixes are displays of raw dexterity, impressive tricks, and clever transitions.

These are exhibitionist DJs. In addition to turntablists (who focus on cutting and scratching), there are “controllerists” and other live performers who display mastery of the craft. And listening to them, without watching, is only half of the story. This DJ might be described as playing their gear “like a musical instrument”.

What About Producers?
People often confuse DJing with music production. While DJing is hosting pre-recorded music to an audience, producing is the original creation or recording of music. Put simply: someone produces a techno song, and then a techno DJ plays that song at a festival.

It may seem confusing, because many performances are hybrids of these two concepts. When the creator and performer of a song is the same person, you might refer to them as a DJ/Producer.

The point is that there are many different types of performers: some are strictly DJs, some play a “live PA” (complete with hardware synthesizers or drum machines), and some land in-between. It’s a spectrum.
